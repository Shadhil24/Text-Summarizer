# End-to-End NLP Text Summarization Project

This repository hosts an end-to-end natural language processing (NLP) text summarization project aimed at summarizing conversations between people. Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques and models, this project covers the entire pipeline from data ingestion to model evaluation and prediction.

## Key Components:

Data Ingestion: The project begins with the ingestion of conversation data. We utilize the SAMSum dataset, which contains a rich collection of conversational exchanges spanning various topics and scenarios.

Validation and Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality is essential for effective model training. This phase involves thorough validation checks to identify and rectify any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset. Additionally, preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, cleaning, and normalization are applied to prepare the data for model training.

Model Selection and Fine-Tuning: For text summarization, we employ the Google PEGASUS model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture known for its exceptional performance in summarization tasks. The model is fine-tuned on the SAMSum dataset to adapt its parameters specifically for conversation summarization.

Training: The fine-tuning process involves training the PEGASUS model on the annotated conversation data. This step aims to optimize the model's weights and biases to accurately generate concise summaries of the input conversations.

Evaluation: To assess the performance of the trained model, rigorous evaluation metrics are employed. Common metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores are used to measure the quality of the generated summaries compared to human-written references.

Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is ready for making predictions on new, unseen conversation data. The trained model takes as input raw conversational text and produces succinct summaries, capturing the essence of the dialogue.

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether it's fixing bugs, implementing new features, or improving documentation, your contributions can help enhance the functionality and effectiveness of the text summarization model.
